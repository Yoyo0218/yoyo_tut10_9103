## Description
1. Automatic looping animation
The animation will loop automatically and clear the canvas regularly. 
2. Time-Based animation
I chose a time-based approach, using timers and events to create the animation.
3. Differences from other members
I changed the color of the shapes and canvas. And I used a timer and easing technique to make the shapes grow and shrink smoothly, as well as setInterval() to clean the canvas periodically.
4. Technical Sources
I mainly used techniques from the Week 5 and Week 9 tutorials.
